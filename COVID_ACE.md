## Abstract
    Early in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were raised about the relationship between the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and infection with *SARS-virus*. This concern was due to the use of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to gain entry into the cell. There was concern that patients using medications effecting the ACE2 receptor might have a significantly different clinical course and possibly increased mortality. Many studies have since examined this question using a variety of different analytic methods. We sought to examine the VA experience *using a causal effects analysis.*
## Introduction
